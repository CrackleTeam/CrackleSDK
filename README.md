[License](LICENSE)

Sparkle is a modding system for Snap!, Jameson, and Snavanced! (with more languages on the way!). It's a fork of the [Crackle extension](https://github.com/CrackleTeam/CrackleSDK) designed to speed up development and improve the overall user experience.

More stuff coming soon!

## Branches
For the latest known-good version of Sparkle (not a guarantee!), use the `main` branch; for the development version that's chronically broken, use the `unstable` branch. Use both at your own risk!
